	\innerlist {
		\entry{\textbf{2023, first project:}
				worked with a trader/researcher to implement
				a tool for analyzing and calculating
				some historical data of securities
				for determining risks and benefits of holding a bond.
		}
		\entry{\textbf{2023, second project:}
				made the OCaml language work with gdb/lldb debuggers:
				extended the OCaml compiler with debug
				info of variable types,
				implemented support for variant types
				and for OCaml in lldb.
				Before that, it was not possible to print
				the contents of OCaml variables in the debugger.
				Code is open source \link{https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/flambda-backend/compare/main...tonowak:flambda-backend:dwarf-bool}{here}
				and \link{https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/llvm-project/compare/main...tonowak:llvm-project:add-variant-support}{here}.
		}
		\entry{\textbf{2022, first project:}
				extended a company product for their clients
				to support multiple types of securities.
		}
		\entry{\textbf{2022, second project:}
				designed and implemented an asynchronous system for
				retrieving and sending data across multiple
				sources, with a focus on reconnections,
				error handling and correctness.
