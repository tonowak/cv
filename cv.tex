    In total, three internships, two projects each.
	\innerlist {
        \entry{\textbf{Example project -- OCaml compiler with debuggers}:
            Made the OCaml language work with gdb/lldb debuggers.
            Extended the OCaml compiler with debug
            info of variable types,
            implemented generic support for variant types
            and specifically for OCaml in lldb.
            Before that, it was not possible to print
            the contents of OCaml variables in the debugger.
            Code is open source \link{https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/flambda-backend/compare/main...tonowak:flambda-backend:dwarf-bool}{here}
            and \link{https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/llvm-project/compare/main...tonowak:llvm-project:add-variant-support}{here}.
            The project was successful, I made my \textbf{master's thesis} about it.
        }
        \entry{\textbf{Technical challenges:}
            The wide spectrum of projects made me work on both low-level high-latency
            system (one project required optimizing a system that is run on thousands of CPUs)
            to designing high-level systems (one project required extensive design of a system
            that could fail at any moment).
        }
        \entry{\textbf{Non-technical challenges:}
            A few projects were open-minded and required me to understand where the project
            will head. In one project I had to communicate closely with a non-developer
            to understand the product that he asked for.
        }

    \entry{\textbf{Rust language tooling:}
		\link{https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14623}{My bachelor's thesis} is about extending a linter for the Rust language
			that detects semantic versioning violations.
			\textbf{Wrote a \link{https://predr.ag/blog/semver-violations-are-common-better-tooling-is-the-answer/}{blog post}} describing the important results of the thesis.
			It is now used by companies like \textbf{Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Mozilla, Adobe},
        and by some of the biggest Rust libraries.}
